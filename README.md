### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from Portland, OR. My interests mostly involve mathematics/data science (my educational background), natural language processing, and modern documentation-management practices (specifically, docs-as-code + Jamstack).

I'm the creator of [Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale), a command-line tool that brings code-like linting to prose. I also wrote and maintain [`prose`](https://github.com/jdkato/prose), a natural language processing library for the Go programming language.
